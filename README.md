# keeper-app-v2
Full-stack MERN notes app with authentication

## Description
I have expanded the React project from Angela Yu's Web Development course to a simple full-stack app, 
using Node.js and Express to let users implement CRUD operations in an AWS hosted MongoDB Atlas database. Users
must login or register - user passwords are salted and hashed with bcrypt.

## Usage
Anybody is welcome to clone and change this repo. Use npm install to install node modules. 

## Contributing
Contributions welcome.

## Link
This project is hosted here: https://note-keeper-client.herokuapp.com/

(The server is deployed as a seperate heroku app)
